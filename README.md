🧠 VitalFocus AI — Smart Study & Home Automation System

An AI-powered real-time system that monitors student focus using computer vision and controls smart home appliances — all through a single camera feed.


📌 Project Bio
VitalFocus AI is an intelligent desktop application built with Python that combines pose estimation, object detection, hand gesture control, and IoT communication into one unified pipeline.
It watches you study through your webcam — detecting whether you're focused, distracted, or taking a break — and simultaneously lets you control smart home devices (light, fan, AC) using just your hand gestures hovering over virtual buttons on screen.
When distraction is detected continuously for 10 seconds, the system automatically triggers a buzzer alert via an ESP32 microcontroller over serial communication. The home appliance states (light, fan, fan speed, AC, AC temperature) are also synced to the ESP32 in real time.
This project is ideal as a student productivity tool, smart home demo, or an IoT + AI portfolio project.

⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourname/vitalfocus-ai.git
cd vitalfocus-ai
2. Install dependencies
bashpip install opencv-python mediapipe ultralytics pyserial numpy
3. Download YOLOv8 model
bash# Automatically downloaded on first run, or manually:
pip install ultralytics
python -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; YOLO('yolov8n.pt')"
4. Connect ESP32

Connect ESP32 via USB
Update port in main.py if needed (default: COM7)
Baud rate: 115200


🚀 Running the App
bashpython main.py

Press ESC to exit
Place your index finger tip over a button and hold for 1 second to activate it
Sit in front of the camera for focus detection to work


📡 ESP32 Serial Protocol
The system sends two types of serial messages every frame:
STUDY,FOCUSED,120,30,10,0        # status, focus_time, distraction_time, break_time, buzzer
HOME,1,1,2,0,24                  # light, fan, fan_speed, ac, ac_temp

🎯 Focus Detection Logic

⚠️ Alert System

Distraction timer starts counting when DISTRACTED state is detected
If distraction is continuous for 10 seconds → buzzer_should_play = True
Buzzer state is sent to ESP32 via serial
Timer resets as soon as focus is regained


🔧 Configuration
You can tweak these constants in main.py:
pythonHOVER_SECS        = 1.0   # Seconds to hover to activate button
DISTRACTION_DELAY = 10.0  # Seconds before buzzer triggers
HEAD_MIN          = 80    # Min head angle for focus
HEAD_MAX          = 100   # Max head angle for focus
MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD = 15   # Max arm movement for "stable"
BUFFER_SIZE       = 15    # Smoothing buffer size
FOCUS_SCORE       = 10    # Min focus frames in buffer
